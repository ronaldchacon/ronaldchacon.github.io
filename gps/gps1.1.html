        <h2>What is Pair Programming Important to DBC</h2>
        <p>
            Allows us to get a better feel to solve problems, communications,
            a development standard and also the ability to learn from each other.
            Also a great method to setup a Mentor/Mentee program.

      <ol>
        <li>What was it like to pair for the first time?</li>
          <ol>
            <li>It was a new experience. It is a bit different from just normal pairing because there is a guide involved. However I feel having a guide or an overseer is great because we can learn effective ways to pair program</li>
          </ol>
        <li>What worked?</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Doing a driver and navigator setup worked very well in our GPS 1.1 callenge. I feel this is the most effective method for pair sessions over hangouts</li>
          </ol>
        <li>What didn't work?</li>
          <ol>
            <li>If there are technical issues it can affect the performace of the team. This was not a huge issue during GPS 1.1 however this can have a bigger effect in later GPS sessions.</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Did you enjoy it?</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Yes. It was a very enjoyable experience and working with my partner helps me understand different point of views.</li>
