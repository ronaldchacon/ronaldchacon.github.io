      <h2>My Thinking Style</h2>
      <p>September 11, 2014</p>
      <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
      <p><img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/rckismet87/folders/Jing/media/62a01783-ba7b-4046-b29a-1c39e9226637/00000015.png" width="400" height="200" style="float:right;">After taking the 'Personal Thinking Styles' quiz, it turns out I tied between Concrete Sequential and Abstract Sequential. I feel this is a pretty close representation of how I tend to learn. I also scored pretty high in Concrete Random. Overall I feel this test got me pretty well. </p>
      <p>After looking at some of the ways a CS/AS thinker learns best I feel I can use these techniques to help my team and also help myself to adapt or try different studying techniques. For example at DBC I will have access to experts and I will be in a stimulating environment I will be able to learn really well. Also I will be able to communicate my ideas to my team.</p>
      <p>Up to this point in Phase 0, I do notice that some of the struggles a CS/AS thinker has I have had as well. These tend to be focused around  dealing with abstract ideas and demands to "use your imagination". I feel I have always had this problem as I tend to reason and be 'too' logical.</p>
      <h3>Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>Between these two mindsets, I feel I heavily fall in a Growth mindset. I think it has to do with the way I brought and also growing up with a grandma that had a degree in child development must have helped with my mindset.</p>
      <h3>Action Plan</h3>
      <p>Knowing my mindset and thinking styles, I am going to start doing tasks that require creativity and researching on how to deal with absract ideas.</p>
