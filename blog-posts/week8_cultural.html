      <h2>Confronting a Conflict</h2>
      <p>October 19th, 2014</p>
      <p>In general I rarely have conflicts with people. I would say the majority of conflicts are generally with myself. </p>
      <p>A recent conflict with myself was a feeling of burnout. This was due to a lack of growth in my previous job. This is how I ultimately came to the decision of attending DBC.</p>
      <p>In order to handle my self-conflict I made a list of pros and cons to see if DBC was right for me at this time. Ultimately the pros really outweighed cons. After doing this, my feeling of burnout started to become less and less as I was going to do something I always wanted to do for my career.</p>
      <p>If I could go back, I would not change any decision I made. If I could go back even further, I would have applied to DBC much sooner than I did.</p>
      <p>Overall I learned that I should what makes me happy, especially at this point in my career.</p>
