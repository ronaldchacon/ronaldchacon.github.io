      <h2>Intellectual Property challenges</h2>
      <p>September 18, 2014</p>
      <h3>The issue</h3>
      <p>
      The recent flurry of patent buying and selling activity in the global tech sector illustrates dramatic changes in the way some of the biggest technology companies are approaching their intellectual property.
      </p>
      <p>
      Companies that have traditionally focused on building a strong patent portfolio, generating additional revenue from their past efforts by reportedly selling or licensing some of their IP rights. And at the same time, companies with little or no internal IP have been rapidly buying in patent portfolios to fend off potential law suits.
      </p>
      <p>
      An example of this is Yahoo suing Facebook, prior to Facebook's IPO.The accusation was based on IP. This led to a countersue by Facebook and Yahoo added more patents to their case.
      </p>
      <h3>Patent Trolls and Complex IP</h3>
      <p>
      Such developments underline the increasingly complex global IP environment for tech companies. The rising threat of litigation, coupled with record numbers of patent filings around the world, means that it is more important than ever for IP departments to ensure that their companies products and technologies do not infringe third-party patents.
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the threat of litigation is compounded by the activities of patent trolls. Patent Trolls are particularly prevalent in the tech sector, as reflected in CPA Global survey. Almost 50% of respondents identified NPEs as one of their biggest concerns over the next 12-18 months.</p>
      <h3>What's Being Done?</h3>
      <p>To help companies cope with these new IP challenges, it is essential that they put in place an effective, well structured FTO search process. Many organisations may already have processes established, but they often do not have adequate resourcing to conduct the extensive searches required.</p>
      <p>Increasingly, they are turning to specialist external providers to help with the FTO process. Such providers can serve as a cost-effective extension to the in-house teams, providing the necessary bandwidth to undertake comprehensive FTO activity.</p>
