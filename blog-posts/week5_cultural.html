      <h2>My experience with Pairing in DBC</h2>
      <p>September 23rd, 2014</p>

      <h3>Pairing</h3>
      <h4>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h4>
      <p>This is something I had been doing since college. In my degree, MIS, it really stressed teamwork.</p>
      <h4>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h4>
      <p>I find being able to solve the solution within a team is very rewarding. Also another benefit is being able to understand how other colleagues would come to a solution.</p>
      <h4>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h4>
      <p>Pairing remotely was a new experience and it was a bit uncomforable pairing remotely my first time. However, after the first one, it was very easy to pair.</p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <h4>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h4>
      <p>I think it was interesting. I never had someone rate me on how well I am to partner with. I really liked the system as it helped me improve over time, and I feel I have been doing so over time.</p>
      <h4>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h4>
      <p>Yes, I feel the feedback was very helpful, as it helped me correct some things I was not doing. For example, I like to get right into the problem, while others do not. With the feedback I was able to slow it down and get to know my partner.</p>
      <h4>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h4>
      <p>Overtime, I have been slowing down at working with others. My inittial pairing wasn't the greatest and it was because I rushed the whole pairing experience.</p>
      <h4>How was it to write feedback?</h4>
      <p>Writing feedback is relatively easy. However I feel it can be hard hard to write feedback if you don't know what to say or how to start. I know this was the case for me, as I really know didn't know how to write constructive feedback. However looking at feedbackinator, I was able to get a better grasp. </p>
      <h4>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h4>
      <p>The only hard part that I have is when I think my partner doesn't have anything improve on. For example, some people I pair with are really good and programming and working on teams and pairing is a breeze.</p>

      <p>Overall I think pairing and feedback is a great way to boost learning as it can realy help with my weak points. For example, if my partner feels I am struggling with a Ruby concept, I can focus on that while I study. Also with the feedback application, this can help a lot with working in teams at DBC and in the future as a developer.</p>
