  <p>Based on the research we tried to make many of the blocks have a width of 100% so they scaled with the page width. This worked really well until the navigation where we had to tweak the CSS for the unordered list.</p>
  <p>A question that arised was floating items and styling unordered list. This was easily solved by refering to challenge 4.</p>
  <p>After this week, my only concern is with media queries. However I feel with some practice I will have it down. As for understanding responsive vs fluid I feel very comfortable in working with the two. Learning both felt great and also helped me work on my SOLO project.</p>
  <p>My favorite part of this challenge was decoding the issues with the content being able to scale down. I did not find any part of this challenge tedious as it was very rewarding to make a page fluid</p>
